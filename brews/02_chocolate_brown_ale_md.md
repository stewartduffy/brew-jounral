**Notes:**
* A few mistakes here. Didn't have all the gear out & ready (big pot, other measuring jug), which made me have to rush.

* Next time - more cold water, maybe ice bath.

**Tasting Notes**
1. Bitter / slightly burnt after taste, not nice bitter, but homebrew bitter. Probably due to high temperature when starting the brew & missing brew enhancer.
